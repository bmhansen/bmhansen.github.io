Hi, I'm Brad Hansen and I'm a University of Waikato computer science graduate.

I'm seeking a career as a software engineer as I love exploring new ways of doing things and attacking hard problems.

I have created a reception area android app for booking appointments, a chrome extension that lets you explore the world simply by opening a new tab and even had a go at a VR game among other [projects](/Projects/) you can check out.
